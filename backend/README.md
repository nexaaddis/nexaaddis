### Features

- **Contact Information Management**: CRUD operations for managing user contact information, including first name, last name, business name, email, phone number, and messages.
- **Newsletter Subscription Management**: CRUD operations for managing newsletter subscribers with email validation.
- **MongoDB as a Backend Database**: Uses MongoEngine, a Python Object-Document Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses `.env` files to manage sensitive variables and configurations securely.
